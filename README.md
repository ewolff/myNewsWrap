## What to expect?
This is the repository for my personal video podcast about news from the area of development with SAP and Microsoft, especially the combination of both. You find all the links to the sources I refer to in my video podcast available in my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/drchristianlechner/) in this repository. 

Each episode will be covered in a new branch. 

The information is opinionated e. g. I love serverless, so expect something about Azure Functions and will clearly focus on development, extension and integration topics. In addition I am not the IaaS expert, so if you are specifically interested in this topic I would recommend the [SAP on Azure](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQOn5Ia5ML0qFRNY1XJbd5g) channel.

## Why?
I must anyway curate the news around SAP and Microsoft to keep up in my daily work. So instead of putting it together just for me, why not share this information. 

And let us be honest, in addition, this puts some pressure on me to do it in an organized way and regular manner :-)  

## When?
I aim to publish episodes regularly aiming at every week, but let us see how things evolve.

## How to give feedback and contribute?
I am happy to receive feedback via issues. This way you can also draw my attention to stuff that you want to propose to be mentioned in future episodes and that I have missed. 

## Next Date
The next podcast will be streamed on Friday, 11th of September at 02:00 pm on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/YqmkUm3cjP8)

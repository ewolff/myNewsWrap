# Episode 128: myNewsWrap ‚Äì SAP and Microsoft

Welcome to this week's edition of myNewsWrap, news from the world of SAP, Microsoft and the world in between.

## SAP Universe - from the community

Let's us start with the SAP side of the house i. e. news around the Business Technology Platform and news from the broader SAP ecosystem:

* [Updating machine types on Kyma runtime enabled](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/03/26/updating-machine-types-on-kyma-runtime-enabled/)

Coming from the Business Rules Space (aka BRFplus) this blog post makes me sad: [SAP Build Process Automation ‚Äì Business Rules fail](https://blogs.sap.com/2023/03/25/sap-build-process-automation-business-rules-fail/) by Phil Cooley

## Microsoft Universe

Now let's look at the Microsoft universe.

### Azure Functions/Serverless

Here is what happened this week in the serverless space like Azure Functions and Static Web Apps:

* Now this is the way: [Azure Functions: Version 4 of the Node.js programming model is in preview](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/azure-functions-version-4-of-the-node-js-programming-model-is-in/ba-p/3773541?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004195) by Lily Ma
  * and for Durable Functions users be aware of this: [Durable Functions for NodeJS 3.0.0-alpha.4](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-durable-js/releases/tag/v3.0.0-alpha.4)
* Very good overview on the new storage providers for Durable functions: [Unlocking the Potential of Azure Functions | Azure Functions Community Standup](https://www.youtube.com/live/e6XMEBLDXOk?feature=share) - however the moderation was really disturbing the session, so I recommend to focus on the slides.

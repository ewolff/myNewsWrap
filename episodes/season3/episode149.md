# Episode 149: myNewsWrap – Microsoft, GitHub and SAP

Welcome to this week's edition of myNewsWrap, news from the world of Microsoft, GitHub, SAP ... and the world in between. The focus of my newsletter is the *application development* and all things around that can improve our lives as developers.

Let's dive into the news and explore what came up this week that can help us to build better solutions for our customers.

## Microsoft Universe

First we take a look at the Microsoft universe and what crossed my path there.

### Serverless - Functions, SWA and Azure Container Apps

Apps need to run somewhere and a very convenient way to run them is *serverless*. What came up this week in this space?

#### Azure Container Apps

* Azure Developers - Python Day [Building intelligent Python apps and microservices with Azure Container Apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xxpn-bJes0&t=14548s) by Pamela Fox and Anthony Chu
* [Azure Container Apps Community Standup - August GA announcements!](https://www.youtube.com/live/zt9ZSkmhydU?si=88aG_J6yrX7fK1bN)

### Dapr

Having containers is nice but everything (well ... nearly everything 😉) gets better with [Dapr](https://dapr.io/) as an outstanding tool for app development in the container-based area. Here we go what might be worth a look:

* [Dapr completes 2023 security audit – increasing enterprise confidence](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2023/09/06/dapr-completes-2023-security-audit-increasing-enterprise-confidence/) by Yaron Schneider
* [Introduction to Dapr and how its benefits to EDA](https://medium.com/@harshil_kansagara/introduction-to-dapr-and-how-its-benefits-to-eda-f8903b923735) by Harshil Kansagara
* [How to run WebAssembly/WASI application (Spin) with Dapr on Kubernetes](https://dev.to/thangchung/how-to-run-webassemblywasi-application-spin-with-dapr-on-kubernetes-2b8n) by Thang Chung

### Developer Platform

This section collects all news touching the topic of a *developer platform*. Fuzzy term but here you find news on topics that make the life of developers easier beyond pure development be it *Infrastructure as Code*, *GitHub* and more like the [Azure Developer CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev).  

#### Infrastructure as Code

* [The OpenTF fork is now available!](https://opentf.org/fork) - but be aware that you are violating the terms of use if the Hashicorp Terraform registry when using it. So some puzzle pieces are missing in the OpenTF story to make it complete.
  * GitHub [repository](https://github.com/opentffoundation/opentf)

#### GitHub

GitHub comes with a blast of new features and enhancements every week. Here are my top 5 news from GitHub that you should check out:

* [GitHub Issues & Projects – September 7th update](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-09-07-github-issues-projects-september-7th-update/)
* [GitHub - Understanding Workflow Permissions](https://dev.to/pwd9000/fgjgghjgh-19ka) by Marcel Lupo
* [How to build an enterprise LLM application: Lessons from GitHub Copilot](https://github.blog/2023-09-06-how-to-build-an-enterprise-llm-application-lessons-from-github-copilot/) by Shuyin Zhao
* [GitHub Copilot – September 7th Update](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-09-07-github-copilot-september-7th-update/)

> Want to see all news around GitHub? I recommend to have a look at GitHub's [blog site](https://github.blog/) as well as at its [change log](https://github.blog/changelog/) to get the complete overview.

#### Azure Developer CLI

Close to my heart as essence of how to make the developer life easier is the [Azure Developer CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev). What's up in this area?

* Azure Developers - Python Day [Speedrun your Python Development with azd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xxpn-bJes0&t=3399s) by Savannah Ostrowski
* [Azure Developer CLI (azd) – September 2023 Release](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sdk/azure-developer-cli-azd-september-2023-release/)
  * [Release notes](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/releases/tag/azure-dev-cli_1.3.0)

### The best of the "rest"

No matter how the structure of this newsletter is crafted, there is always something that does not perfectly fit. This section is dedicated to topics that I think are worth reading but did not fit into the structure from above:

* [Microsoft announces new Copilot Copyright Commitment for customers](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) by Brad Smith
* [Open AI Cost Gateway Pattern](https://theprestonverse.com/2023/08/30/open-ai-cost-gateway-pattern/)
  * [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ThePreston/Custom-Rate-Limiter-API#open-ai-cost-gateway-pattern)
* A bit beyond Microsoft but anyway: [Cloud Native Weekly - Ep 14 - What a beautiful Landscape!](https://www.youtube.com/live/-6ke04Ohc4w?si=3ll4qwQOy36XD2IE)

## 🐱‍👤 SAP and Microsoft - Combining both worlds

Combining Microsoft with SAP can lead to incredible new applications. Let's enter the *twilight zone* (no worries the ninja cat is with us) between SAP and Microsoft and see what's up here:

* [SAP on Azure Video Podcast #159 - The one with Fusing SAP and Microsoft (James Wood & Paul Modderman)](https://youtu.be/Ynycc7m7zpk?si=kanNDoJ-VXKfWp5D)

> And of course a channel that you should subscribe to if you are working with SAP and Microsoft is the [SAP on Azure](https://www.youtube.com/@SAPonAzure) hosted by [Holger Bruchelt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/holger-bruchelt/) and friends.

One important (and imho best part) of the job of a developer is the *continuous learning*. Here are some interesting learning resources that go beyond vendor-specific technology:

# Episode 147: myNewsWrap – Microsoft, GitHub and SAP

Welcome to this week's edition of myNewsWrap, news from the world of Microsoft, GitHub, SAP ... and the world in between. The focus of my newsletter is the *application development* and all things around that can improve our lives as developers.

Let's dive into the news and explore what came up this week that can help us to build better solutions for our customers.

## Microsoft Universe

First we take a look at the Microsoft universe and what crossed my path there.

### Serverless - Functions, SWA and Azure Container Apps

Apps need to run somewhere and a very convenient way to run them is *serverless*. What came up this week in this space?

* [Golem Unveils a Resilient Computing Platform for Serverless Workers with WebAssembly Component Model](https://www.infoq.com/news/2023/08/unveiling-golem-cloud-wasm/) by Steef-Jan Wiggers

#### Azure Functions and Static Web Apps (SWA)

* [Azure Static Web Apps Community Standup - Enterprise Architecture for JavaScript with SWA & Azure](https://www.youtube.com/live/H6ohcIJkULk?si=hS83zHxaZmwdVRee)

#### Azure Container Apps

* [Deploying an Event-Driven-Job with Azure Container App Job and Azure Service Bus](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/deploying-an-event-driven-job-with-azure-container-app-job-and/ba-p/3909279?wt.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004195) by Karthi Teja Malyala
* [KEDA is graduating to CNCF Graduated project](https://keda.sh/blog/2023-08-22-keda-cncf-graduation/) - this is great news, especially as part of the ACA "stack"

### Dapr

Having containers is nice but everything (well ... nearly everything 😉) gets better with [Dapr](https://dapr.io/) as an outstanding tool for app development in the container-based area. Here we go what might be worth a look:

* [Dapr Community Call - August 23rd ](https://youtu.be/nWatANwaAik?si=NV57zViEGNhvRnVm) with:
  * Component dynamic reloading
  * CLI developer experience improvement for K8s
  * Local debugging Dapr apps with Docker Compose
  * Community show & tell

* [Orchestrating Stateful Workflows with Dapr | ABP .NET Conference 2023](https://youtu.be/WLVljfolSPs?si=xf5w0dVRWH5mdAIw)

### Developer Platform

This section collects all news touching the topic of a *developer platform*. Fuzzy term but here you find news on topics that make the life of developers easier beyond pure development be it *Infrastructure as Code*, *GitHub* and more like the [Azure Developer CLI](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev).  

#### Infrastructure as Code

Of course also this week a topic - license change at Hashicorp:

* [HashiStack Live Stream - August 2023](https://www.youtube.com/live/FVvGIjzTehE?si=tPcTzPCsxjH8TmVr) featuring Armon Dadgar - CTO of HashiCorp
* and it is happening: [OpenTF Announces Fork of Terraform](https://opentf.org/announcement)

But also something interesting from the infrastrcuture from code area:

* [Infrastructure From Code: Serverless as it was meant to be](https://youtu.be/J6dyQWgNDuQ?si=cTWkuXdHHIFd3ibn) by Emrah Samdan

#### GitHub

GitHub comes with a blast of new features and enhancements every week. Here are my top 5 news from GitHub that you should check out:

### The best of the "rest"

No matter how the structure of this newsletter is crafted, there is always something that does not perfectly fit. This section is dedicated to topics that I think are worth reading but did not fit into the structure from above - this week with some AI

* [Build an enterprise-ready Azure OpenAI solution with Azure API Management](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/build-an-enterprise-ready-azure-openai-solution-with-azure-api/ba-p/3907562?wt.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004195) by Julia Kasper

## 🐱‍👤 SAP and Microsoft - Combining both worlds

Combining Microsoft with SAP can lead to incredible new applications. Let's enter the *twilight zone* (no worries the ninja cat is with us) between SAP and Microsoft and see what's up here:

* [SAP on Azure Video Podcast #157 - The one with SAP, Teams, Power and AI - Internship @ Microsoft (Noopur Vaishnav)](https://youtu.be/JOwDbzEB9yA?si=ftaVXV9BQ0loHW6m)

## Learning

One important (and imho best part) of the job of a developer is the *continuous learning*. Here are some interesting learning resources that go beyond vendor-specific technology:

### Golo's Corner

One great resource for becoming a better developer and reflecting about our profession is the high-quality content of [the native web GmbH](https://thenativeweb.io/) by [Golo Roden](https://twitter.com/goloroden). This week the following topics were on the list:
